Learn about weak areas in a target system
=========================================

As a **person evaluating a new AI system**
I want to **get an overview of various LLM security risks a model presents**
So I can **figure out if I want to deploy it**

How it looks
------------

We learn how to configure garak to connect to our target, and then immediately 
run with defaults, and get a report in a reasonable amount of time that helps
us learn something actionable about our target's weaknesses and risks. 
Not a lot of documentation is read or should be needed.
