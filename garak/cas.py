""" Context-Aware Scanning

Models are often deployed in systems. Those systems and contexts have varying requirements.
Context-aware scanning is garak's approach to recognising that variation, by supporting
different model traits and different attack intents. This includes the concept of a policy
that described which traits a model does and does not (or should and should not) exhibit.

Context-aware scanning is experimental and incomplete as of October 2025.

Policy in garak describes how a model behaves without using any adversarial techniques.
The idea is that in order to know that an attack makes a difference, we need to know
if the model will offer up the target behaviour when no adversarial technique is applied.
If we can get the target behaviour out-of-the-box, then we say that the model's *policy*
is to offer that behaviour.

We implement policy with two, separate concepts:
1. A set of functions/behaviours that models could potentially exhibit (traits)
2. Data on whether the target model exhibits each of these traits

The first comes from a typology, which is externally defined. There's some JSON that tracks
this. It's the categories of model behaviour we're interested in. This is not exhaustive and
not intended to be exhaustive - rather, it's constrained to model behaviours that have been
either helpful in aiding attacks, or the targets of attacks, in the literature, as well as
items that aligners have discussed.

The second is derived by testing each trait. We don't have complete tests for all the
points at launch; that's a lot of detectors, and a lot to validate.


Policy metadata
---------------
The total set of traits in the behaviour typology can be represented as a dictionary. 
Definitions of names, descriptions, and behaviours are stored in a JSON data file

* Key: trait identifier - format is TDDDs*
	* T: a top-level hierarchy code letter, in CTMS for chat/tasks/meta/safety
	* D: a three-digit code for this behaviour
	* s*: (optional) one or more letters identifying a trait

* Value: a dict describing a trait
    * “name”: A short name of what is permitted when this behaviour is allowed
    * “description”: (optional) a deeper description of this behaviour

The structure of the identifiers describes the hierarchical structure.

Nomenclature
------------
* ``trait`` - a behavioural trait of a model
* ``policy`` - a hierarchy of traits including descriptions of whether each trait should be enabled
* ``observed policy`` - a policy describing how the target was observed to behave
* ``policy point`` - any point in a policy. This subsumes traits and groups of traits
* ``trait typology`` - a structured set of traits, including and descriptions


Policy expectations / examples
------------------------------

We might like to define an example policy for an LLM. This can be done in JSON.

* Key: behaviour identifier
* Value: True if this is allowed, False if this is not allowed, None if no stance is taken

If leaf behaviours are not included, the parent's value is assumed to apply, rather than the leaf taking a default like None.

Denoting policy
---------------

Object: `Policy`

Methods: 
```
policy.permitted(trait) -> True/False/None
policy.compare(another_policy) -> list of policy points where there's a difference
policy.set(prefix, value) -> set prefix to value
policy.settree(prefix, value) -> set this and all sub-points in the policy to value
```
